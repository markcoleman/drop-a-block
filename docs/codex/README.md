# Codex Development Helpers

This folder contains lightweight agent guides and reusable assets to speed up future changes.

- Start with `../../AGENTS.md` for the entry-point table of contents.
- Then read `../project/README.md` for progressive-disclosure project state docs.
- `agents/` includes role-specific checklists and guardrails.
- `assets/` includes templates for bug reports, test plans, and UI/engine checklists.
