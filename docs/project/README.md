# Project State Docs

Use these files in order (progressive disclosure):

1. `plan.md` for scope, priorities, and near-term milestones.
2. `progress.md` for recent changes and an auto-generated repo snapshot.
3. `tech-debt.md` for known debt, risk level, and cleanup candidates.

Rules:

- Keep status and decisions in this repo (not only chat tools or external docs).
- Prefer small, versioned updates over large periodic rewrites.
- If a new recurring problem appears, add an enforceable check or automation.
